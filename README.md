# Habitmaker
## A simple approach to changing human behavior.

## The Rules

1. Create a habit. You can't create more than one at a time i.e. complete the one created in the preset amount of time to create another.
2. If you fail the habit, you can restart it, and a "Failure" will be noted within the row.
3. If you complete the habit (or delete the "in progress" habit), you can create a new one.


## Installing

- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm start` or `yarn start` (depending on your previous command)
